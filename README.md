# RISC_CPU

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the processor based on the given Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). The processor is designed to execute instructions defined by specific opcodes, micro-routines, and arguments.

### Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

The ISA consists of multiple instructions, each identified by an opcode and executed through a defined micro-routine. The structure of an instruction is as follows:

Opcode: A unique binary code representing an instruction.

Micro-Routine: The sequence of operations performed by the control unit to execute an instruction.

Description: A brief explanation of the instruction.

Flags: Indicators that store the result of operations, such as comparison outcomes.

Arguments: Registers or values required by the instruction.

### Example Instructions

Below are some example instructions from the ISA:

JMP R1 (0001): Jumps to the memory address stored in register R1.

CMP R1, R2 (0010): Compares R1 with R2 and updates flags.

ADD R1, R2, R3 (0011): Adds the values in R1 and R2, storing the result in R3.

### Processor Features

Supports basic arithmetic and logical operations.

Implements jump and branch instructions.

Utilizes flags for conditional operations.

Designed for efficient instruction execution through micro-routines.

### Usage

To execute a program on this processor:

Load instructions into memory.

The processor fetches and decodes instructions based on the opcode.

The corresponding micro-routine executes the operation.

Results are stored in registers or memory as needed.

### Future Enhancements

Support for additional instructions.

Optimization of micro-routines for efficiency.

Expanded register set for greater flexibility.

This README serves as a foundational guide to understanding and utilizing the processor effectively.
